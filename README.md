# My personal page and blog - [vikash.me](http://vikash.me)
This code powers my personal website hosted on Google App Engine. I learned a lot about front end development and design while building this. Its fully responsive and build without using any UI framework or library, just using flexbox(which is cool by the way!). It was a great learnin process and I am proud to showcase it here.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/codervikash/vikash.git`.
2. Run `npm install` to install npm dependencies.
3. Run `gulp dev` for dev build or `gulp` for prod build. Run `gulp watch` to watch for changes in repo
4. To run server locally `dev_appserver.py app.yaml` or `gcloud app deploy  app.yaml --project <project_name>` to deploy to app engine.
